Why get these instead of the newer Lithium-ion?,lithium-ion
Research on the web shows that Lithium-ion batteries have a shelf life between 2-3 years.,research,web,batteries,shelf,life,years
"So, unlike Ni-cads, EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE THEM, they will degrade and need replacing in a couple of years.",ni-cads,couple,years

I am Very pleased with this DeWalt 18 volt drill.,volt,drill
It would be good if one could change the voltage just by using a switch on the charger from 110 to 240 volts instead of having to buy a reducing transformer from 240 volts down to 110 volts.,voltage,switch,charger,volts,transformer,volts,volts
I think that those from outside the USA should be told that only 110 volt outlet can be used and other countries with differant outlets will need a reducing transformer.,volt,outlet,countries,outlets,transformer
However it was still a lot cheaper having to spend the extra money buying a 240v down to 110v transformer than buying a DeWalt 18 volt battery drill from Australia.,lot,money,transformer,volt,battery,drill
