I've finally had enough of a hands-on with this camera to draw some conclusions about it.,camera,conclusions
My main body is a 5D II and I've owned or used almost all of Canon's crop bodies.,body,5D,crop,bodies
HANDLING AND NEW FEATURES: Build quality on first impression is similar to the 60D and 5D II.,FEATURES,quality,impression,60D,5D
"Solid enough, with a slightly narrower grip than most previous Canon bodies, those two inclusive, but still comfortable to my large hands.",grip,bodies,hands
"This body is petite for full-frame, about 10% smaller by volume than the 5D II and 15% under the 5D III.",body,%,volume,5D,%,5D
"Weight is similarly svelte, below every 5D and the 7D, and about even with the 60D.",5D,7D,60D
The larger cameras will balance a bit better with heavy lenses; this 6D will be the preferable travel body by a small margin.,cameras,bit,lenses,6D,travel,body,margin
New relative to the 5D II are improved weather sealing and a much-appreciated mode dial lock.,5D,weather,mode,dial,lock
"It's not clear how comprehensive the sealing is; I still wouldn't take it in the rain, and very few non-L Canon lenses are weatherproof.",rain,Canon,lenses
The LCD screen has a fatter aspect ratio and somewhat better contrast.,LCD,screen,aspect,ratio,contrast
"As seems to be the new Canon norm, the 6D has mushy buttons that activate at some indeterminate point.",norm,6D,buttons,point
"Novel, however, is the button layout.",button,layout
"The top panel retains the 60D's configuration of four buttons, each with one function.",panel,60D,configuration,buttons,function
"The 5D series, 7D, and prior XXD models have three buttons with two functions per.",5D,series,7D,XXD,models,buttons,functions
"You lose direct adjustment of flash exposure compensation and white balance, but frankly, most people will find this simplified layout preferable.",adjustment,flash,exposure,compensation,balance,people,layout
I still forget which dial controls which function on my 5D II.,dial,controls,5D
"The rear panel looks superficially like the 60D with the same right-hand bias, though the functionality has been shifted around.",panel,60D,bias,functionality
"A mitigating factor is that, as on the 7D, 60D, and subsequent bodies, you can bind custom functions to many buttons.",factor,7D,60D,bodies,custom,functions,buttons
"I didn't find it a major trial to adapt from the 5D II, but you'll definitely want to spend a few days with it before you have to work under pressure.",trial,5D,days,pressure
Rebel owners will find the adjustment more significant.,Rebel,owners,adjustment
This 6D has a single SD card slot.,6D,SD,card,slot
"The 5D II uses CF, which is rapidly becoming the purview of only high-end bodies.",5D,CF,purview,bodies
"CF is faster, harder to lose, and costs more.",CF
SD is fast enough for a body in this speed class.,SD,body,speed,class
This is nonfactor unless you have a sizeable collection of the opposing format.,nonfactor,collection,format
The 5D III has a dual slot that can speed some workflows and provide media redundancy.,5D,slot,workflows,media,redundancy
"Like all Canon full-frame DSLRs, this body doesn't have a popup flash.",DSLRs,body,popup,flash
"I'm not lamenting the absence, it was a bone to casual shooters more than a serious tool.",absence,bone,shooters,tool
"Max sync speed for most Canon bodies is around 1/200, so integrated flash only works for outdoor fill with narrow apertures.",sync,speed,bodies,flash,fill,apertures
"Indoors as a main light source, the tiny size and close proximity to the lens lead to red eyes and a flat, unflattering high-contrast look.",light,source,size,proximity,lens,lead,eyes,look
"A much preferable setup for any Canon DSLR pairs a 430EX or 580EX, ideally diffused or aimed to bounce off a nearby surface.",setup,pairs,430EX,580EX,surface
"Shutter lag now rivals the 5D III and 40D-7D, a few ticks quicker than the 5D II and any of the Rebels.",lag,5D,40D-7D,ticks,5D
This responsiveness bodes well for the first shot.,responsiveness,shot
"Later shots come at 4.5 fps, a rate ideal for candids, but not for sports.",shots,fps,rate,ideal,candids,sports
The 5D II and III are respectively worse (3.9 fps) and better (6 fps).,5D,fps,fps
"Of greater interest: like the 5D III, the 6D now has a 'silent' shooting mode that lowers the volume and pitch of the mirror clunk by half.",interest,5D,6D,'silent,shooting,mode,volume,pitch,mirror,clunk,half
Every wedding I've ever shot would have benefited from that.,wedding
The screen interface follows the mold of every Canon body since the 40D.,screen,interface,mold,body,40D
It has a series of horizontal tabs with options.,series,tabs,options
"The major UI change is that instead of 9 tabs that also scroll vertically, you get 15 that don't.",UI,change,tabs
The advantage is that you can rapidly wheel through tabs and see everything there is to see without scrolling; the disadvantage is that it looks intimidating and there are multiple tab groups of the same icon.,advantage,wheel,tabs,everything,disadvantage,tab,groups,icon
The 'Creative' modes show every tab.,'Creative,modes,tab
Some are hidden in Program and Auto modes.,Program,Auto,modes
"We've come full-circle since the original 5D, which had a handful of tabs and piles of scrolling.",5D,handful,tabs,piles,scrolling
A major new feature also common to the 5D III is a better implementation of Auto-ISO.,feature,5D,implementation,Auto-ISO
"It's often the case in changing light where you want to shoot a lens wide open for subject isolation, but with a fixed or minimum shutter speed so you won't risk motion or hand blur.",case,light,lens,isolation,speed,motion,hand,blur
"On the 5D II, that was a no-go; Auto-ISO didn't work in Manual mode, and the minimum shutter chosen in the other modes was too low.",5D,Auto-ISO,mode,modes
This camera will do Auto-ISO in M between any lower and upper bound you choose.,camera,M
Or you can set a minimum shutter for Av or P mode.,shutter,P,mode
Some other new features are worthy of note.,features,note
They've added a single-axis level that's useful for landscapes and architecture.,level,landscapes,architecture
The GPS feature will tag images with a location and can also keep a constant breadcrumb position log (at significant cost to battery life) that you can layer on a map later.,feature,images,location,breadcrumb,position,log,(,cost,battery,life,),layer,map
"And they've added wireless networking, so you can control the camera by smartphone or laptop with a live video feed.",networking,camera,smartphone,laptop,video,feed
"I can do that with my 5D II, but it requires a cable or USB-wireless converter dongle.",5D,cable,converter,dongle
"In theory, you can also upload to Facebook by way of a Canon bridge website, but I didn't test this.",theory,upload,way,bridge,website
AUTOFOCUS: AF is a marginal improvement over the 5D II.,AF,improvement,5D
"Performance and customizability are somewhat better, but usability suffers.",customizability,usability
"First, context: unlike a phone, point-and-shoot, or mirrorless body, DSLRs don't use the image sensor (""contrast detect"") to focus for still photography through the viewfinder.",context,phone,point-and-shoot,body,DSLRs,image,sensor,contrast,photography,viewfinder
That means you don't get face detection or any sort of scene recognition at all.,face,detection,sort,scene,recognition
"Instead, you've got a handful of 'AF points' in a diamond configuration.",handful,'AF,points,diamond,configuration
Each point covers a tiny area of the frame.,point,area,frame
"If you let the camera choose the point, it'll pick whichever is sitting on a contrasting edge (i.e., a clear dark/light edge; anything that isn't a flat color).",camera,point,edge,edge,anything,color,)
Maybe that'll be an eye.,eye
It could just as easily be a button.,button
The first major habit to acquire with a DSLR is picking your own focus points.,habit,DSLR,focus,points
"On the 5D II, there's a joystick on the back to individually select any of the 9 AF points with a single click.",5D,joystick,back,AF,points
The phase sensor has 6 invisible AF-assist points to help track motion.,phase,sensor,AF-assist,points,motion
"Minimum light to focus with the center cross-point is -0.5 EV; in my case, that translated to an exposure of 1/50, f/2, ISO 25600 with a 100/2.",light,center,cross-point,EV,case,exposure,f/2,ISO
"Very dim, but not impossible to see and not out of the ISO capacity of this body or certainly the 6D.",ISO,capacity,body,6D
Shooting by moonlight or dim exterior lighting could benefit from greater AF sensitivity.,Shooting,moonlight,exterior,lighting,AF,sensitivity
The 6D excels in this area.,6D,area
"The center point is rated to -3 EV, a full 2.5 stops below the 5D II and is, in theory, at least a stop under any other Canon DSLR.",center,point,EV,5D,theory,stop
"There's essentially no handheld exposure, even with an f/1.4 or f/1.2 lens, for which this camera won't catch focus.",exposure,f/1.4,f/1.2,lens,camera,focus
But it's missing the 5D II's joystick; you have to awkwardly shift your thumb further down to use a less precise 8-way rocker panel.,5D,joystick,thumb,rocker,panel
"If you choose not to bind AF to the shutter button, you'll wear out that digit in a hurry.",AF,shutter,button,digit,hurry
"Also, the system now has 11 AF points (with no additional coverage), so you can't directly select the two outer points anymore.",system,AF,points,coverage,),points
"As to motion tracking, the 6D's AF diagram suggests it may also have 6 or 8 AF-assist points.",motion,tracking,6D,AF,diagram,AF-assist,points
"The manual doesn't say, and if they exist, they're not selectable.",manual
"Either way, the same rules from the 5D II apply: if you're tracking a high-contrast object centered in the viewfinder in decent light, it works well enough.",way,rules,5D,object,viewfinder,light
All bets are off if you need to rely on the outer points.,bets,points
Likewise for using the outer points with wide-aperture lenses; they don't always hit.,points,lenses
You'll want to take a lot of safety shots if focus is critical.,lot,safety,shots,focus
There are a few new custom functions to fine-tune AI Servo.,custom,functions
"As with the 5D II, the 6D supports AF microadjustment, though now with separate settings for the wide and long ends of zoom lenses.",5D,6D,AF,microadjustment,settings,ends,zoom,lenses
Also interesting is the ability to link the AF point with camera orientation; helpful if you're switching from portrait to landscape repeatedly.,ability,AF,point,camera,orientation,portrait,landscape
"To the extent it's possible to narrow a wide array of AF characteristics to a 10-point scale, here's how I'd subjectively rate Canon's various bodies: Center point / Outer points / Motion tracking | Body 9 / 9 / 9 | 5D III 6 / 6 / 7 | 7D 6 / 5 / 5 | 40D/50D/60D/T4i/T5i 8 / 3 / 4 | 6D 6 / 3 / 4 | 5D II 6 / 3 / 3 | T2i/T3i/SL1 Some scenarios will show greater disparities than these numbers suggest.",extent,array,AF,characteristics,scale,rate,bodies,point,points,Body,|,5D,7D,40D/50D/60D/T4i/T5i,6D,5D,|,T2i/T3i/SL1,scenarios,disparities,numbers

"Likewise, very fast or erratic objects may flummox every camera here but the 5D III.",objects,camera,5D
"I've ranked the 5D III's center point higher because, while it can't match the 6D in moonlight, it has significantly higher accuracy and consistency with recent Canon lenses.",5D,center,point,6D,moonlight,accuracy,consistency,lenses
Per-pixel sharpness is very high and superior to crop bodies-- par for the course for a full-frame sensor near this pixel density.,sharpness,crop,bodies,course,sensor,pixel,density
Dynamic range is similar to the 5D II and 5D III.,range,5D,5D

"I'd run this body to ISO 12,800 without much thought.",body,ISO,thought
Colors at low ISO are indistinguishable from any other Canon DSLR.,Colors,ISO
Shadow noise has improved over earlier bodies.,noise,bodies
"A common shooting technique is to meter for highlights and raise the shadows in post to make darker details visible, the manual equivalent of Canon's 'Auto Lighting Optimizer'.",shooting,technique,meter,shadows,post,details,equivalent
Boosting the shadows with a 5D II eventually reveals banding patterns and a blue cast.,shadows,5D,banding,patterns,cast
"The 5D III fixes the banding, but retains the color cast.",5D,fixes,banding,color,cast
The 6D doesn't have either.,6D
"While Nikon still holds a narrow lead on this point, 6D files are cleaner than every other Canon body save the 1D X.",lead,point,6D,files,body,1D,X
"To get the most out of this DSLR, you'll want to shoot raw.",DSLR

Adjustments to raw files in post are vastly more flexible than the Picture Styles that control the 6D's JPEG engine.,Adjustments,files,post,Styles,6D,engine
"Those provide only rudimentary adjustments to tone, sharpening, and color.",adjustments,tone,color
"With challenging lighting (mixed white balance, high or low dynamic range, or changing light), Picture Styles can give a suboptimal result, complicated in part by metering.",lighting,(,balance,range,),result,part,metering
"In low-dynamic-range scenarios (e.g., a cloudy day), 'evaluative metering' tends to give a dull, low-contrast picture.",scenarios,day,picture
"With a high DR scene (e.g., a sunny day with deep shadows), blown highlights and clipped shadows will be exacerbated by a high-contrast Picture Style set for the earlier scene.",DR,scene,day,shadows,shadows,Style,scene
"If you're careful configuring the body and the stars align, you can get decent JPEG output and forego work in post, but I consider a fast computer and a photo management system like Adobe Lightroom to be less complements than necessities.",body,stars,JPEG,output,work,post,computer,photo,management,system,necessities

First off let me say that I love my Canon T2i.,T2i
I have probably taken 20-30 thousand shots with it and it still is going strong.,shots
However - I wanted a full frame sensor camera body and wanted wireless (more to preview pics taken immediately on my nexus 7 tablet than to control my camera) Anyway - after un-boxing - I couldn't believe it.,frame,sensor,camera,body,preview,pics,nexus,tablet,camera
It makes my T2i appear as if it were a toy (as far as build quality + weight + bigger size).,T2i,toy,(,quality,weight,size,)
There are features that I discovered that will instantly make my photos better.,features,photos
One example - there were times that I would struggle getting my horizon straight while on a side of a hill using a tripod.,example,times,horizon,side,hill,tripod
"This camera has a built in level that is view-able on your LCD screen (during live view), and it turns green when you have it level and its red when it isn't.",camera,level,LCD,screen,(,view,),level
I know that's a small thing - but - that's one less thing to do in post processing.,thing,thing,post,processing
There are many other features that come standard on the 6D that I only had available on my T2i after installing Magic-Lantern.,features,6D,T2i
Also I love that they give you Photo size options in RAW.,size,options,RAW
With the T2i shooting RAW - you can only shoot LARGE.,T2i,shooting,RAW
Although that's how I will shoot a majority of still shots - doing time lapse stuff when you only require HD (1920x1080) that extra size and quality comes with an expense (lots of disk space / memory and processor needs for your PC to process) The GPS is a nice feature - but when you use that and the wireless (or really just the GPS on its own)- it will suck the life right out of the Battery.,majority,shots,time,lapse,stuff,HD,),size,quality,expense,(,lots,disk,space,memory,processor,needs,PC,process,GPS,feature,(,GPS,life,right,Battery
So even with these options turned off - I doubt seriously that I'll get half the life from this battery as the T2i gets from its battery.,options,life,battery,T2i,battery
It was nothing for me to shoot 2000 shots in a single time lapse session (during a 2-3 hour window) on 1 charge.,nothing,shots,time,lapse,session,(,hour,window,),charge
To defend the 6D there is more hardware to drive.,6D,hardware
Make sure you get a spare battery.,battery
So I have only had this for three weeks now - have taken about 200 test photos and I absolutely like it.,weeks,test,photos
Cant wait for better weather and to know that the Sun really does exist.,wait,weather
Having said all of this - its the image quality that counts.,image,quality
I haven't taken a photo yet that's made me say wow!,photo,wow

I was limited to Canon because of my investment in lenses.,investment,lenses
I opted for this camera versus the new 70D even though it meant that I was condemning several lenses I own to use only with my backup Canon SL1.,camera,lenses,backup,SL1
Buying this camera with the 24-105mm lens was significantly more expensive than the the 70D alternative both in terms of upfront cost and obsolescence of some of my lenses (e.g.,camera,lens,alternative,terms,cost,obsolescence,lenses,e.g
Tamron 18-270mm Di II due to substantial vignetting).,)
